<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### Deploy

First thing we gonna do after we are done with the set up stuff is deploy the contract:

```
yarn hardhat deploy
```

This will automatically deploy to our local Hardhat network, if we wanna deploy to a real network like Rinkeby type in:

```
yarn hardhat deploy --network rinkeby
```

## Testing

After deploying the contract we can do some test, locally:

```
yarn hardhat test
```

Or on Rinkeby:

```
yarn hardhat test --network rinkeby
```

### Test Coverage

This allow us to have a clue about the coverage of our test

```
yarn hardhat coverage
```
